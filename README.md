# 🧠 DSA – Brute Force to Optimized

This repository tracks my **Angular + DSA Interview Prep Plan**.  
I’m solving **DSA problems** (LeetCode / Striver’s A2Z) while preparing for frontend developer interviews.  

Each solution is committed with **two versions**:
- 🐢 **Brute Force Approach** → First principles, clear & simple, less efficient  
- ⚡ **Optimized Approach** → Improved using time/space analysis, patterns, or better data structures  

---

Each **problem folder** contains:
- `brute-force.*` → Naive implementation  
- `optimized.*` → Efficient solution
